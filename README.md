Quickcheck Clone implemented in Racket.

This implementation was written by Michael Sperber as part of the "deinprogramm" teachpack in DrRacket.
I extracted it as an independent package for use with the new package manager in DrRacket. All collaborators are listed at [the usual place](https://github.com/ifigueroap/racket-quickcheck/graphs/contributors).

The documentation is available here:

Contributions are welcome! In particular, more examples for the documentation would help.
